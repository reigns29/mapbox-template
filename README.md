# React Mapbox GL with Draggable Marker and Mapbox Geocoding API

This is a simple example of a React app that uses React-map-gl and Mapbox-gl to display a map with a draggable marker. The app also uses Mapbox Geocoding API to show the address of the marker on click.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository using git clone "https://github.com/reigns29/mapbox-template".
2. Install the required dependencies using "npm install".
3. Create a .env file in the root of the project and add your Mapbox API access token as "REACT_APP_MAPBOX_TOKEN = your-mapbox-token".
4. Run the app using "npm start".

## Usage

1. Once the app is running, you will see a map centered at a default location with a draggable marker.
2. Drag the marker to your desired location and click on it to see the address in a popup.
